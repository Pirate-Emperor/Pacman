## Features

- **Maze Navigation**: Players control Pacman using the arrow keys to navigate through the maze.
- **Dot Collection**: Pacman collects dots scattered throughout the maze to earn points.
- **Ghost Avoidance**: Players must avoid the ghosts that roam the maze, as contact with a ghost results in losing a life.
- **Power Pellets**: Consuming power pellets allows Pacman to temporarily eat ghosts and earn extra points.
- **Level Progression**: After clearing a level, the player progresses to the next level with increased difficulty.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks the player's score based on dots collected and ghosts eaten.
- **Lives Counter**: Displays the remaining lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.
